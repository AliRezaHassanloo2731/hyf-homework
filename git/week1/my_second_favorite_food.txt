Instructions
In a food processor, add the cilantro, parsley, and green onion/leeks and chop well. You can definitely chop by hand but of course, it’s not as easy. Set aside.
Combine the ground beef, onion, salt, and pepper by hand. Set aside.
Add the uncooked rice to a small bowl and add the egg to it. Whisk well. Set aside.
Add the Doogh (yogurt drink) to your biggest pot as it can overflow in the first steps if you aren’t watchful. Stove is off at this time. And as mentioned, if you don't have doogh, simply take plain yogurt and mix with a little water until you get it to the consistency of milk.
Add the rice and egg mixture to the doogh in the big pot. Mix with a wooden spatula and turn on the stove to high heat.
Stir the entire time until after it reaches a boil (~20 minutes). Once it boils, continue stirring for 2 more minutes, then turn the heat down to medium. At this point you can stir occasionally.
Next we will add the rest of the ingredients. Make sure nothing is cold going into the soup.
Little by little while stirring, add the chopped cilantro, parsley, and leeks/green onions.
In your palms, ball the beef mixture into small meatballs about the size of a marble. As you form them, drop them into the soup. They will start to pop up and float when they are cooked.
Give a gentle stir with your spatula.
Slowly while stirring, add the rinsed white beans and garbanzo beans.
Allow to simmer for a few minutes and add the garlic a few minutes before serving. To intensify the garlic flavor, add it in, give the soup a stir and serve about 1 minute later. For a more mellow garlic flavor, add it in, allow the soup to boil for a few minutes and simmer on medium/low until you’re ready to serve.
